Hello everyone!

This is a simple webapp deployment done on EC2 instances (AWS) with Terraform. It does, however, get interesting when we add the Load Balancing aspect;
Using Terraform and AWS EC2 Load-Balancer, I've created a DNS-route-based load-balancing (when using the URL with path /blue - it directs to the 'blue' HTML page, and vice-versa with the red one).

Hope you enjoy reading it!
